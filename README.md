## 📝 Overview

Evenly is a desktop application designed to take the pain out of splitting bills and tracking debts with roommates, friends, or travel groups. Forget clunky spreadsheets, awkward reminders, or oversharing with third parties—Evenly combines ironclad privacy with a slick UI to make fair sharing effortless.

- **Desktop-native (Java) — No web dependency**
- **Smart splitting: equal, by item, by ratio/percentage, with adjustments**
- **Automated email reminders**
- **Group management and transaction dashboard**
- **Zero manual math & easy record-keeping**

## 🚀 Why Evenly?

Splitting expenses is a human problem, not just a math problem. Evenly is built for people who want:

1. **Privacy by default** — Expenses and credentials never touch anyone else’s server.
2. **Accurate, automated tracking** — No manual entry or nagging needed; Evenly does the legwork.
3. **Desktop power, no distractions** — Focused, responsive, and reliable with your data under your roof.

   - Equal
   - By item (select who ate/used what)
   - By percentage or ratio
   - Custom adjustments (get granular if you want)

2. **Automated Reminders**  
   Never chase payments again. Set expenses, and Evenly sends individual reminders via email until they’re settled.

3. **Local Data Storage**  
   Your expenses are saved to your device, not to a remote database (except for asynchronous, privacy-respecting email dispatch).

4. **Clean, Modern UI**

## 🗺️ Example Scenarios

1. **Roommate rent:**  
   Bob pays the $120 utility bill, Alice and Soum split the bill based on agreed percentages. Evenly emails everyone the amount owed—no more awkward texts.

2. **Weekend getaway:**  
   Create a new “Lake Trip” group, log shared expenses, assign who paid for what, and leave Evenly to settle the rest (including payment reminders).

3. **Group dinner:**  
   Itemize dishes, pick who got what, and let the app auto-calculate individual totals and send reminders.
